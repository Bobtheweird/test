    <h3>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 and 2</h3>
    <p>The whole series is awesome, but these two in particular have awesome graphics and can be quite touching.</p>

    <h3>Greyhound</h3>
    <p>Amazing graphics and somewhat historically accurate.</p>
    
    <h3>Hunter Killer</h3>
    <p>Another great movie, awesome graphics.</p>
